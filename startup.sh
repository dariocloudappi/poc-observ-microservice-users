# startup.sh - startup command of the Azure App Service
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This script IS the startup command: infra/modules/appservice.bicep sets
# appCommandLine to "bash /home/site/wwwroot/startup.sh", and the pipeline
# ships it inside the deployment package next to app.jar.
#
# It exists so that attaching the agent is a decision taken at run time. If
# -javaagent lived in JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS, the JVM would apply it always and a
# missing agent jar would stop the process from starting at all.
#
# The agent is attached here explicitly when JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS does not already
# declare it, so the script instruments the application on its own. If the app
# setting is present, the JVM picks it up by itself and the script adds nothing,
# which avoids loading the agent twice.
